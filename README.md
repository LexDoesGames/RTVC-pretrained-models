# RTVC-pretrained-models
Backup of pretrained models for Real-Time-Voice-Cloning originally made by blue-fish. As blue-fish left GitHub a few months ago, the pretrained models they were hosting on their account dissapeared along with it. Thankfully, someone had backed up the files onto Google Drive, so I am uploading the files here on GitHub so that you can easily modify your code so that it works again.

I did not train these models, blue-fish did. I'm simply re-uploading them onto GitHub so that others can easily re-implement the pretrained models back into their code.
